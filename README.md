# pneumonia-detection
This project leverages generative AI models to enhance pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic but realistic X-ray images, improving the training dataset and reducing overfitting. These synthetic images help train a deep learning classifier—typically a CNN—to accurately distinguish between pneumonia-affected and healthy lungs. This approach boosts model performance, especially when working with limited real-world medical data.
